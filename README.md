## Introduction
Hateful online content is a growing concern, es-
pecially for young people. While social media
platforms aim to connect us, they can also be-
come breeding grounds for negativity and harm-
ful language. This study tackles this issue by
proposing a novel framework called HOLD-Z,
specifically designed to detect hate and offen-
sive comments in Telugu-English code-mixed
social media content. HOLD-Z leverages a
combination of approaches, including three
powerful models: LSTM architecture, Zypher,
and openchat_3.5. The study highlights the
effectiveness of prompt engineering and Quan-
tized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) in boost-
ing performance.
